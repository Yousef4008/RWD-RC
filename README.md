# Wireless-Controlled RWD Robotic Car

ðŸš—ðŸ’¨ Excited to present our latest project - a wireless-controlled Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD) robotic car!

## Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a sophisticated RWD robotic car, integrating wireless control for a futuristic automotive experience. The car is developed from scratch using Fusion 360 for 3D design, and it supports seamless communication via NRF24L01 with a remote control.

## Features

- **Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD):** Ensures smooth and efficient motion transfer.
- **Wireless Communication:** NRF24L01 module for wireless control.
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32 powers the core functionality.
- **Integrated Drivers:** GPIO, Timer, SPI, Buzzer, PWM, L293D, ADC, POT, SERVO, and NRF24L01.
- **Steering Mechanism:** Potentiometer and servo motor for precise control.
- **Codebase Organization:** Layered model (HAL - MAL - Library - LIB - Application) for modularity and maintainability.
